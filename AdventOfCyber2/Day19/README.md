### [Day 19] Special by Tib3rius - The Naughty or Nice List ###

1. What is Santa's password?

	* Followed along with the steps because I have no prior knowledge of Server-Side Request Forgery. The steps led me to the answers.
	* Cool piece of knowledge is that there is a registered domain out there, `localtest.me`, that resolves to 127.0.0.1. Test it out in `nslookup`!

```
Username: Santa
Password: Be good for goodness sake!
```

2. What is the challenge flag?

```
THM{EVERYONE_GETS_PRESENTS}
```
